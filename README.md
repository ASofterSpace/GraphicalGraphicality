# GraphicalGraphicality

**Class:** Spielerei

**Language:** JavaScript

**Platform:** Web

This wants to be a tool for creating interesting graphics - however, it is a very low-level tool, and wants to be played with directly inside its JavaScript source code!

## Setup

Just get this source code, and you are ready!

## Run

To start up GraphicalGraphicality, you can open the index file in a browser of your choice:
